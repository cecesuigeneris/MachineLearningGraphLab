# MachineLearningGraphLab

This is my study notes from coursera - Machine Learning Courses by Washington University. It uses GraphLab (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphLab), a graph-based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++, to perform machine learning tasks. GraphLab Createâ„¢ (developed by Dato) is a Python library that includes a simple Python interface on top of a fast C++ engine. The user guide can be found at https://dato.com/learn/userguide/

Two things you need to install: (1) iPython Notebook; (2) GraphLab Create

## Foundation Course (6 Weeks)
### 5 Case Studies - Machine Learning Method/Model:

Note: The course is divided into two parts. Each week a new case study is investigated, and GraphLab functions are taught for each specific task. Only general concepts are explained, no nitty gritty algorithms for each ML model studied. 

* Predict House Price - Regression 
* Sentiment Analysis - Classification 
* Document Retrieval - Clustering 
* Product Recommendation - Matrix Factorization 
* Visual Product Reccomender - Deep Learning
